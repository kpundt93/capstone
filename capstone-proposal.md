### Name of Student: Katie Pundt

### Name of Project: Personal Cookbook (WIP name)

### Project's Purpose or Goal:

As someone who likes to cook, I have recipes scattered in many different locations. I have dozens saved on Pinterest, cookbooks full of sticky note bookmarks, and some written down on paper from my mother. I've wanted a place to centralize all of my favorite recipes for a while now and would like to create a web app to give users a place to store and organize their favorite recipes.

### List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
- A user can create, read, update, and delete their recipes
- User authentication
- Users can categorize recipes and filter by those categories

### What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
- C#
- MySQL
- React
- HTML/CSS/JS
- React Bootstrap

### If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
- OAuth for user authentication
- Users can upload photos to their recipes
- Users can search by ingredient or category or both
- Host on Azure

### What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
- OAuth
- Azure

### Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
I've been going back and forth about the best way to create this app. I'm tempted to use C# and MySQL to manage my database because I've worked with it before, however I'm not sure this is the best option for images. I've started looking into Firebase and I'm wondering if a NoSQL database like that would be better for this project. If it is, my stack would just be React and Firebase. Any advice would be appreciated!
