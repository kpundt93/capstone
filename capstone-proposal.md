### Name of Student: Katie Pundt

### Name of Project: Personal Cookbook (WIP name)

### Project's Purpose or Goal:

As someone who likes to cook, I have recipes scattered in many different locations. I have dozens saved on Pinterest, cookbooks full of sticky note bookmarks, and some written down on paper from my mother. I've wanted a place to centralize all of my favorite recipes for a while now and would like to create a web app to give users a place to store and organize their favorite recipes.

### List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
- A user can create, read, update, and delete their recipes
- User authentication
- Users can categorize recipes and filter by those categories

### What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
- React
- Firebase
- Firestore
- HTML/CSS/JS
- React Bootstrap

### If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
- OAuth for user authentication
- Users can upload photos to their recipes
- Users can search by ingredient or category or both
- Add ability to scale recipes
- Explore hosting options

### What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
- OAuth
- Netlify, AWS, Azure, GitHub Pages, Heroku -> potential hosting options

### Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
I started this project thinking that I'd use C#, MySQL, and React to create my project. However, after watching some YouTube videos and reading some blog posts, I decided to look at upcoming lessons and research Firebase more. I'm scrapping my original plans and creating this project completely in React and Firebase to push myself out of my C# comfort zone, challenge myself to get more comfortable with React, and learn how to use some new tools.
